# Hybrid recommendation system for library book selection

## Introduction

For my master's thesis I implemented a hybrid recommendation system that could be utilized in libraries for selecting books. The system combines a heuristics based system and a machine learning model to produce recommendations. The system works based on circulation logs and book metadata. There are two components in the system: frontend and backend. Each of these components have their respective dependencies. Backend dependencies are listed in README.md file located in backend folder and frontend dependencies are listed in package.json file located in frontend folder. Backend is built with Python and frontend with React. <b>By no means this system is production ready, it is a part of research.</b>

Backend dependencies and their licenses are listed in backend folder and frontend dependencies and their licenses are listed in frontend folder.
